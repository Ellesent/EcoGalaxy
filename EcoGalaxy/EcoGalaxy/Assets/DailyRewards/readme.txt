Thanks for purchasing this fantastic asset!

Rewarding players for logging in on consecutive days is a great way to increase retention but also helps monetization as players get a sense of the benefit of having more coins/currency within the game.

Usage:
- Daily Rewards:
Drag DailyRewards and DailyRewardsInterface to a GameObject and adapt to your UI.
You add or remove days by adding or subtracting the Rewards array inside the DailRewards object. The values inside the array represents the prize.
Check the DailyRewardsExampleCanvas or DailyRewardsExampleGUI

- Timed Rewards:
Drag TimedRewardsInterface to your scene and adjust the UI components. 
You can change the timing by editing the "COINS_TIMER" constant inside TimedRewardsInterface script.
Check the TimeRewardsCanvas scene to get you started.

This asset uses the client's machine time. If you want to use Server Time, please check the Server provider and adapt the script accordingly.

Don't forget to run your application on background!

Enjoy!
